# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

## Structure:

The repository is organized by year, with each year containing a separate folder. Within each year's folder, you'll find:

* A separate folder for each day's puzzle (e.g., `day01`, `day02`).
* Each day's folder contains the puzzle input (`input.txt`) and my solution code (usually in Python, filename may vary).

## Notes:

* This repository is primarily for my own reference and learning. 
* Feel free to explore the solutions, but try to solve the puzzles yourself first!
* The code may not always be the most efficient or elegant, but it should get the job done. ðŸ˜‰ 

## Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
